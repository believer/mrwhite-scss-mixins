Mr. White SCSS mixins
===========

I made [Mr. White LESS mixins](https://github.com/believer/mrwhite-less-mixins) and this is a port of the mixins to SCSS.

## Installation
Install it using [Bower](http://bower.io) by running

    bower install mrwhite-scss-mixins --save

on your command line.

When the download is done, import `mixins.scss` in to your project and use the mixins as suggested in the documentation above each mixin.
